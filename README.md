# Simon-Game
A simple replica of Simon game with Vanilla JavaScript 

I personally coded the entire application from the styling to the working.
It basically gives user a heads start by giving him the first pattern to remember
and stores it in an Array.
and checs the user input against the arrays values index-vise
if an wrong input is given the game is over. 

the game goes on infinitely until user makes a mistake.
